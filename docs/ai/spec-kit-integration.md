# Spec Kit Integration Guide

> Combine this template with [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) to enable a spec-driven development workflow.

## Goals and Benefits
- **Consistent specs**: Commands such as `/constitution`, `/specify`, and `/plan` generate structured requirements and technical plans that complement existing process docs.
- **Cross-tool alignment**: Spec Kit works with GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude, and other assistants, letting you reuse the same specs across tools.
- **Automation pathway**: Pairing Spec Kit with CI and privacy checks delivers an end-to-end flow from spec → code → validation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (manage with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if possible)
- Installed and configured `git`
- Access to GitHub Releases to download Spec Kit dependencies

```bash
# Recommended: install the specify CLI via uv
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# For one-off usage
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify --help
```

> On macOS with zsh, if `uv` is missing, run `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` and follow the prompts to add it to your PATH.

## Bringing Spec Kit into the Repository
### 1. Back up and clean the workspace
- Ensure `git status` is clean or work from a dedicated branch.
- Because `specify init` creates template files, consider a separate `spec-kit` directory or branch.

### 2. Initialize the Spec Kit layout
```bash
# From the repository root; --here reuses the current directory, --ai copilot matches the assistant
specify init --here --ai copilot --force
```

Key directories created after initialization:

| Directory/File | Purpose | Suggested alignment with the template |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memory/constitution.md` | Project principles and rules | Align with `docs/process/project-lifecycle.md`; cross-reference as needed |
| `memory/specs/` | Functional specifications and requirements | Map to business docs inside `docs/`; consider a `docs/specs/` subdirectory |
| `templates/` | Task scripts and prompt templates | Compare with `docs/ai/prompt-library.md` and merge relevant scenarios |
| `.github/workflows/specify.yml` | (Optional) workflow sample | Merge with existing CI flows if conflicts arise |

> To keep the root clean, store Spec Kit artifacts under `docs/spec-kit/` and update `.spec-kit/config.toml` output paths.

### 3. Coordinate with the Team
- Sync key principles from `memory/constitution.md` into `docs/ai/custom-instructions.md` or other team norms.
- Provide Copilot Chat preset explanations for Spec Kit commands so teammates understand `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/implement` sequencing.
- Add a “spec alignment” item to PR templates or review checklists to confirm implementations match the latest specs.

### 4. Automation Integration
- Create a dedicated workflow in `.github/workflows/` that runs `specify check` to verify tooling availability.
- When spec documents change, reuse `check_sensitive_info.py` to prevent local path leaks.
- Script synchronization of `memory/specs/*.md` into the relevant `docs/` directory to reduce manual effort.

## Recommended Workflow
1. **Define principles**: Use `/constitution` to establish team agreements, documenting them in `docs/process/`.
2. **Draft specs**: Generate clear business requirements with `/specify` and `/clarify`, saving them under `memory/specs/`.
3. **Plan solutions**: Leverage `/plan` and `/tasks` to outline the technical approach and task breakdown, optionally creating GitHub issues.
4. **Implement**: Execute tasks (via `/implement` or manually) and run the repository’s lint plus privacy checks before committing.
5. **Review and sync**: Update specs, docs, and release notes so `docs/` and `memory/` remain aligned.

## FAQs
- **Conflict with existing docs?** Add a “Generated by Spec Kit” note at the top of generated files and explain your sync strategy in PRs.
- **Control generated content?** Reinforce `.copilot/config.json` style rules and remind Copilot during `/plan` or `/implement` to follow repository conventions.
- **Teammates without install rights?** Offer one-off `uvx` scripts or centralize spec generation/validation in CI.

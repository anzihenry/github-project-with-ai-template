# Project Lifecycle Workflow

Use this workflow to keep development pace and quality control consistent when working with the template.

## 1. Requirements & Planning
- Capture requirements: log background, goals, and acceptance criteria with the issue templates.
- Prioritize work: plan milestones or build a project board.
- Assess technology: identify dependencies, risks, and Copilot assistance needs.
- Confirm commit standards: align as a team using `docs/github/commit-message-guidelines.md`.

## 2. Development Phase
- Create feature branches and link them to the relevant issues.
- Follow the coding and documentation conventions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Leverage prompts in `docs/ai/prompt-library.md` to streamline development.

## 3. Review & Integration
- Open pull requests and complete the checklist in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Review for code quality, security, and process alignment.
- Ensure all CI/CD checks pass before merging.

## 4. Testing & Verification
- Run automated tests, manual checks, or canary deployments as appropriate.
- Document test evidence and, when needed, attach it to the pull request.
- Surface issues quickly and coordinate fixes collaboratively.

## 5. Release & Delivery
- Prepare release notes using `docs/process/release-management.md`.
- Tag the release and capture key changes plus upgrade guidance.
- Inform stakeholders or users and supply deployment instructions.

## 6. Maintenance & Retrospective
- Monitor metrics and feedback after release to evaluate impact.
- Revisit process documentation regularly and keep checklists current.
- Record lessons learned in `docs/process/` to benefit future projects.

Following these steps helps teams reuse and continuously refine the template across initiatives.

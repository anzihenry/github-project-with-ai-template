# Contribution Guide

Thank you for helping improve this GitHub project template! Follow the steps below to get started quickly and keep contributions consistent.

## Baseline Expectations
- Review `README.md` and `docs/github/repo-setup-checklist.md` to understand the repository layout.
- Keep documentation updates in English and ensure terminology stays consistent.
- Open or link to a relevant issue before submitting a pull request.

## Development Workflow
1. Fork or clone the repository and work from a dedicated feature branch.
2. When adding or changing configuration, update the relevant documentation (for example `docs/ai`, `docs/process`).
3. Run the required checks before opening a pull request (GitHub Actions locally with `act`, linters, tests, etc.).
4. When submitting a pull request, follow the checklist in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and ensure CI pipelines pass.

## Code and Documentation Style
- Add comments or reference links to configuration files when parameters need clarification.
- Organize Markdown with second-level headings and concise bullet lists.
- For Copilot-related content, align with the practices in `docs/ai/copilot-guidelines.md`.

## Issues and Discussions
- Use the provided issue templates and include context plus reproduction steps when reporting defects.
- For feature proposals, describe the business background and expected benefits.

## Releases and Versioning
- Releases are managed via GitHub Releases; track changes in `docs/process/release-management.md`.
- When introducing major functionality, document migration or upgrade guidance.

If anything about the contribution process is unclear, start a discussion or open an issue. Thanks again for your support!
